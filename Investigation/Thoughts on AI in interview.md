For years (and even now in 2025), the standard interview loop at Meta looks like 

1. Tech Screener (leetcode)
2. Full Interview Loop
	1. Leetcode again
	2. Leetcode again
	3. System Design
	4. Misc
At some companies the full interview loop may discard one of these leetcode questions or add in their own flare - e.g. at Motherduck I made a presentation on a project I was proud of and how it worked internally, but the chemtrail that Meta has left is clear: Leetcode dominates the interview cycle. This was the case at Doordash, Current, Spotify, Motherduck, Palantir, Verkada, and many others. These companies use Leetcode similarly to how U.S. universities (used to) use the SAT as a near-top-level heuristic for applicant grit; if you can put in the time to memorize the techniques for these problems, you're hardworking enough for us.

AI has changed this. At a recent interview with Doppel (after a traditional Leetcode-style screener mind you), I was given a totally open-ended question and told to use Claude code, ChatGPT, and whatever else I'd like to mock up the core functionality of the company (fraud detection) in 4 hours. This is the reality of AI - what would make for a great system design question is now entirely feasible in code. Thus, a new high-water mark for how applicants ought to think - and study. After completing the bare minimum requirements for the question using little AI, I was told I should have ideated with more velocity - I should have used more AI. What are we testing then - my prompt engineering skills? As a full time dev, I understand that this interview is much more indicative of the day-to-day of a SWE in 2025 especially at a startup, but doesn't this incentivize the wrong kind of studying? How can one even study for an interview like this? Are the best performers on interviews like this really skilled vibe coders, and are those the people we really want to hire?

Don't get me wrong, Leetcode is still absolutely everywhere, but this feels like something we'll laugh at in a few years. SATs are still a useful hueristic and part of a larger picture for college applicants the same way Leetcode ought to be. But maybe those are the grumblings of someone who did well on both of those old school exams and struggles with this new era.
