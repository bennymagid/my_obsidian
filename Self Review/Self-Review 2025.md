![[[MANAGER VERSION] Technical Team Performance Review - Google Forms.pdf]]

  Absolutely exceeded my 2025 goals through exceptional productivity and impact:

  Quantitative Achievement:

  - 41 completed Linear tickets across the first half of 2025
  - Leading business-impacting initiatives like CNA Direct Integration (WEB-2890), the Accounting CSV Importer (WEB-2580), and Lead Selling (WEB-2648)
  - Led 3 meetings, spearheading Backend developer best practices (docs found in Notion) e.g. utilizing Lombok better, better logging
  - Internal Library development: ApiResponse, S3Upload, MDC Logging, RequiredRoles
  - Automation: Gitlab auto tag creation, Gitlab auto staging deploy


  **What achievements are you most proud of and why?**

  In addition to product development, I've been able to contribute to the team's efficiency with devops and SRE contributions, too:

  1. Breadth of Impact: My contributions span:
  
  - Major Carrier Integration: WEB-2890 (CNA Direct Integration)
  - Financial Systems: WEB-2580, WEB-2661, WEB-2681, WEB-2733
  - Operational Tools: WEB-2608, WEB-2627, WEB-2648, WEB-2671
  - Platform Infrastructure: WEB-2778, WEB-2705, WEB-2750
  - Account Management: WEB-2692, WEB-2670, WEB-2904

  1. Critical System Reliability: Fixed high-impact issues like accounting math errors (WEB-2681), aggregate operations bugs (WEB-2750), and business record duplications (WEB-2723) as well as many other site-errors.
  2. Onboarding our new Intern, Keaton with the best practices mentioned above



  What do you think are some areas of improvement?

  3. Strategic Focus: While my high ticket volume shows strong execution, I could benefit from identifying 2-3 strategic initiatives to lead more deeply rather than spreading across many tickets.

  

  4. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer: With 41 tickets completed, ensuring proper documentation and knowledge sharing becomes critical

   for team scalability.

  

  5. Mentoring and Leadership: My proven delivery track record positions me to take on more mentoring responsibilities and architectural

  decision-making.

  

  6. Proactive Communication: With this level of output, I should focus on better communicating impact and priorities to stakeholders and

  leadership.

  

  The 41 completed tickets represent exceptional performance that significantly exceeds typical delivery expectations and demonstrates

  both technical excellence and business impact.
