High level of output personally and as a team - a lot of code and failing fast
Been given a lot of space from Avery to be able to give the team better design practices
Avery expects me to be a great mentor to the Intern (maybe even more than one intern)
Incredible success of a first 90 days
Huge impact on the business
This round of majors is shorter (also a month but less stressful)
Next project - really big and revenue-impacting
