**Notes from Dev Den Sync March 21 2025 3-21-2025**
Major goal for 2025: Grow the sales team!
5 new sales hires in 2 months, and they've been very successful
Sales records MoM for 2 quarters now

When Tivly gets back about new campaigns,
Restart LAQ and ensure the new rows in the CampaignStatus table have external IDs
and that when we change the availability of William or Jake, we don't get a NPE
