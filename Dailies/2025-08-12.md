- [ ] Double check logging and cron - pushed changes but didn't deploy carrier-downlaods

AgentMail - can use as a notification (similar to a slack bot to prompt)

Move Repos and Services to common.core (if they sit on top of DB tables)
Make document for how we're actually going to structure common 
all DB entitiues, repositories, and their services live in the core package
everything else would be feature.integration.* or similar
Also prio [this project](https://linear.app/coverdash/issue/WEB-3159/all-crud-endpoints-to-use-the-adminappuservalidationinterceptor)


Tivly should have no workflows, BP should have no workflows, AWL misc - calls should have no workdlows, AWL data leads SHOULD get assigned a workflow

TODO: Write ticket for this mess
 Business comes in 
 1. Coverdash website (should be in a workflow)
 2. Warm Transfer (currently going in workflow because LAQ expects that)
	 1. Exception: Tivlys we receive an API call AFTER the call is picked up, so should have no Workflow!
	 2. Note AWL Data leads are Partners instead of Warm Transfers, so they still expect a workflow
 3. Partners (should be in workflow)
 4. Instant pay partners (from Sonic - those should be in Close but not in workflow because they just purchased)
