Test and potentially add endpoints for WEB-2507
New Project - Accounting

PolicyTransactions rows are used to track payments, fees, cancellations, etc.
BUT there's a lot of back and forth (with Ascend if Agency bill or the carrier if Direct Bill)

AmountReceived (actually received) and Amount (expected amount) and Status (`RECEIVED` or `NOT RECEIVED`) - and this is manually entered by an accounting firm

Want: Build a CSV importer (must define a template)
a bot will take each row External Policy ID and checks to see if there's a NOT RECEIVED row in our DB and checks if the Amount matches.
If it sees a match between CSV and DB, then mark RECEIVED, if not match then show options to resolve.
Can we have the frontend send the CSV and the backend will reply with all affected rows, etc.

Can we also update Transactions By Date table to use PolicySummaries instead of Policy

External Policy, Receivable/Payable, Commission/Endorsement, Amount

Under the `Accounting` dropdown

Will probably want a DB table that tracks the run history and stores the CSV in AWS.
