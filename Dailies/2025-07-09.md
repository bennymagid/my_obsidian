Lending partner strangeness - different insurance requirements for diff biz
We want to handle end to end insurance process for lendistry.
I want to write a loan for this business but they don't have the proper requirements
1. upload your proof of insurance
	1. Understand if it fufills reqs
	2. Show them a cheaper policy if possible
	3. Option to BOR if none cheaper
	4. Ingest the COI 
2. Loan officers from Lendistry dashboard to manage the coverage requirements for their businesses
	1. Pull all COIs from people who uploaded through the tool
	2. They can mark extra
	3. They can themselves mark Lendistry as the "additional insured" on behalf of the user (need a disclaimer)

Down the road:

Consider managing the balance between being a senior dev for others) and doing IC work
