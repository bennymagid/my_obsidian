- [x] Revisit [campaignStatus history](https://linear.app/coverdash/issue/WEB-2570/frontend-update-the-campaign-status-metrics) tomorrow AM 
	- [x] If it looks good, figure out how to fix the math on the Agent Availability page
	- [x] Problems:
		- [x] Agent Status list uses AgentOutOffice table which includes some old employees
		- [x] Deploy local Frontend and backend to test if getting rid of all `null` `endedAt` - may want to do this on a schedule with lambda job
- [x]  Add [MMR changes to prisma uAT](https://gitlab.com/coverdash/quotes-service/-/merge_requests/267)
- [x] Test MMR changes
- [ ] COI with Jon - [WEB-2278](https://linear.app/coverdash/issue/WEB-2278/add-support-for-more-policy-types-to-coi-tool)
	- [ ] Ops gave a list of all different COI requests
	- [ ] COI tool generates the PDFs
	- [ ] Fields filled with CustomCoverageElements
	- [ ] AC:
		- [ ] Review the changes (mainly in common)
			- [x] Common, Crud, service manager
		- [ ] Add the rest of the Coverage Elements - can put "All" for carrier
		- [ ] Code complete - put branches into UAT
		- [x] call Milana, etc. and they'll direct testing
	- [ ] There are 3 to add for all and then another 6 to add for `Inland Marine`
		- [ ] There are a max of 3 Inland Marine policies - have Frontend put this Limit on until then

If Jared is the first one marked in office, then any subsequent Tivly AE won't unpause Tivlys
