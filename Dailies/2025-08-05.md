	- Banks issue SBA loans (backed by the govt.)
	- New insurance requirements for SBA 
		- COI process needs to be better for Lendistry to feel comfrotable givign us SBA loans
	- Current SOTA: Ryan manually adds a Lendistry / Bayfirst rep as the additional insured 
		- Policy must have Blanket AI
		- And policy must have a lenders lost endorsed
		- Ops often has to manually add these no-cost endorsements 
	- Solutions:
		- v1. Auto create Helpscout tickets for Lendistry and Bayfirst when policy is bound
			- On policy bound, we can queue up the COI generation to send it to them with a specific template
			- Helpscout ticket auto created to verify / make the changes necessary to the policy to create the COI that qulaifies for the SBA loan. Then a loops email goes out to Lendistry rep
		- v2: COI analysis and integration:
				- Could AI analyze the COI automatically
					- Does the COI have the required info on it?
						- if AI says it does, can send Lendistry email (and add them to Close, etc. and set a 90-day renewal for the BOR)
						- if the COI does not meet the req. we immeidately reach out to the customer so that they can sign the BOR and qualify for the SBA.
