	- [ ] crud and common branches (and app-service)
	- [ ] 1) When partners createBusiness, no Close lead is created
	- [ ] 2) createApplication is what inserts them into Close
	- [ ] For partners who use preemptive quoting, we don't want them added to Close
	- [ ] License has field (preemptiveQUotingEnabled)
	- [ ] 3) when a page loads on an application 
		- [ ] If application.getViewed is false (it was preemptive), it gets flipped to true AND the BE adds them to Close because they were preemptive
	- [ ] Nerdwallet uses us on their public blog but wants embedded form
		- [ ] insertBusinesstoLaqWhenenabled or similar
		- [ ] if this flag is enabled, when a partner creates a business, it inserts into close
- [ ] Think about quoting engine or LAQ tix for Keaton
