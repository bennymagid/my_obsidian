Lendzi:
- They want to do a warm transfer - internally in their CRM, there's a button that will call createBusiness BUT a customer is only added to close on createApplication
- This will call us round robin
	- We will create a bespoke Ringba number to do this round robin for 1 min
	- There will be an artificial delay to add this to LAQ for 15 minutes
		- if no avail, they will go into LAQ
	- If an agent does pick up, the agent will have to mark themselves as the AE in close
- 3 different flows; this will be tracked in the License
