Expect a re-org for AEs 
3 Teams
1. (highest comp) Warm Transfer (Enterprise teams) - Tivly, etc
	1. Big sales but longer life cycle
	2. ~300-500K in sales per month
2. Access to Warm transfers (run-off from team 1)
3. (lowest pay) Only LAQ leads - 60-80 leads a day
	1. Comp only based on # of accounts sold, not total premium
		1. These team members would have access to `Admitted Markets` i.e. normal insurers we've heard of - these sell `Off the Shelf` quotes
		2. Because of the high volume and low agent-experience, team 3 members will only get `Admitted Markets` leads
			1. But we don't want to lose that customer only because Team 3 can't quote `Wholesellers`
		3. `Wholesellers` are a middleman between agents and carriers to ensure high-quality leads
Most other insurance brokerages silo based on industry, not deal-size

High touch vs. Low touch 
- high touch if they've submitted an application or just revenue and payroll
- otherwise low touch - only automatic texts and call 
Therefore, we receive a lot of low touch leads (50%) and these are great to **sell** to Tivly and bold penguin. They want these leads so badly that they'll give us a bid boost (extra value for our bid requests). We receive 50-75 low touch leads a day.

Want: way to track (and limit) the number of leads (per month) to Tivly and Bold Penguin. Right now it's a 50% chance of getting sold to Tivly or Bold Penguin. **This will not remove the lead from our queue**
Already exists API to sell lead to Tivly (old), but need to write similar for BP

February will be a test month where Haskell is exclusively Team 1 and Jared will be exclusively Team 3

No current way to have an AE only take LAQ leads and not warm transfers (through Ringba)

LAQ communicates with Ringba to ensure no actively-on-a-call AE gets rang.

Ringba forwards to campaigns (Construction, >1M revenue, etc.) and currently every AE is in all campaigns. Similarly, if they're busy, they are unavailable for *every* campaign. 

So if there is a campaign with only 1 person and he is not available, because other AEs exist, that campaign will still be marked as available.

Need a way to group AEs into campaign

Idea: Table to map AE -> Campaign
If AE unavail, get all rows they are a campaign of, for each campaign, get all AEs in those campaigns

Could we cache this - that way lookup is faster
On startup, create hashset from campagin -> all AEs and the reverse. For each AE, get their status from the DB

Infra changes:
- Add table that maps AEs to CampaignStatuses (flattened I.e. multiple AE rows for the same AE)
- Add rows to CampaginStatus to show all the different types of Tivly campaigns (and also a row for bold penguin)
- Then add the specific logic to go from AE to all his CampaignStatuses 

```
ref: setTivlyCampaignsToStatus
ref: setAgentStatusAvailability
ref: uploadLead in BoldPenguinController
```

Note that Tivly has no staging environment so comment out those calls to their API when testing
