SUSPICION OF AI - reading and fake "um let me think"

Frontend collects business info
Make API calls
Interface for interacting with carriers - class 
Asynchronous for latency
Doesn't know what asynchronous meant after saying it
Return happy path quickly
While waiting for another response can show a loading spinner (or an error) message

Enum for quote status 
unique id, user id, name of the business ("Coveradash focuses on small business")
unsure of what a UUID is ...
Each business tied to one user but one user tied to multiple businesses
Repeats question back a lot
industry IDs seems like a specific 
Connection to a carrier quote table
"Each user on that business" even tho many to one said earlier
