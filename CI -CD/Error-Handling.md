[Here](https://medium.com/@AlexanderObregon/enhancing-logging-with-log-and-slf4j-in-spring-boot-applications-f7e70c6e4cc7) is an overview on logging with
Lombok
Spring
SL4J
1. Do we return a bad response like a 403?
2. Is Sentry notified?
3. Do we return a 200 and just log the error
4. log.info vs log.error
5. log messages to users are confusing too
