Can use a [[ðŸ‘• Linter]] to help manage this but we currently do not have any sort of versioning management which means there are many conflicting dependencies and committed dependencies via transitivity![[Screenshot 2025-01-23 at 11.36.05 AM.png]]

Should handle dependencies with Dependabot (which has a GitLab version, but would require some more configuration for Gitlab than in Github)

There is [Gemnasium](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium) for dependency management?

[Amazon S3 SDK should be updated to v2 or v3 for continued support](https://linear.app/coverdash/issue/WEB-2588/upgrade-aws-s3-sdk-from-v1-v2)
