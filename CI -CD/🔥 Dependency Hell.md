Can use a [[ðŸ‘•Linter]] to help manage this but we currently do not have any sort of versioning management which means there are many conflicting dependencies and committe dependencies via transitivity![[Screenshot 2025-01-23 at 11.36.05 AM.png]]

Should handle dependencies with Dependabot (which has a GitLab version, but would require some more configuration for Gitlab than in Github)
