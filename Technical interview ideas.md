# Exemplary Technical Screening Responses

## 1. Technical Background & Motivation Sample Response

"I'm fascinated by Coverdash's mission of simplifying business insurance through technology. As a computer science student at NYU, I've been particularly interested in how technology can reduce friction in complex industries like insurance. Last semester, I built a peer-to-peer insurance risk assessment prototype for my distributed systems class that used machine learning to dynamically price coverage.

My internship at a local fintech startup exposed me to microservice architectures and API design, which aligns perfectly with Coverdash's technical stack. I'm especially drawn to how you're embedding insurance directly into existing business workflows - that's a transformative approach that goes beyond traditional insurance models."

## 2. Coding Challenge: Rate Limiter Implementation (Java)

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;
import java.time.Instant;

public class RateLimiter {
    private final int MAX_REQUESTS = 100;
    private final long WINDOW_SECONDS = 60;
    
    // Thread-safe concurrent map to track API key request counts
    private ConcurrentHashMap<String, RequestBucket> requestTracker = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    public boolean allowRequest(String apiKey) {
        // Atomically update and check request count
        return requestTracker.compute(apiKey, (key, bucket) -> {
            if (bucket == null || isWindowExpired(bucket)) {
                // Create new bucket if no previous data or window expired
                return new RequestBucket();
            }
            
            // Increment and check against max requests
            bucket.incrementRequests();
            return bucket;
        }).isRequestAllowed();
    }

    private boolean isWindowExpired(RequestBucket bucket) {
        return Instant.now().getEpochSecond() - bucket.getStartTime() >= WINDOW_SECONDS;
    }

    // Inner class to track request metrics for each API key
    private class RequestBucket {
        private AtomicInteger requestCount = new AtomicInteger(1);
        private long startTime = Instant.now().getEpochSecond();

        void incrementRequests() {
            requestCount.incrementAndGet();
        }

        boolean isRequestAllowed() {
            return requestCount.get() <= MAX_REQUESTS;
        }

        long getStartTime() {
            return startTime;
        }
    }
}
```

**Design Explanation:**

- Used `ConcurrentHashMap` for thread-safe, distributed tracking
- Implemented atomic operations to prevent race conditions
- Sliding window approach with per-API key granularity
- Automatically resets window when threshold or time expires
- Minimal memory overhead by tracking only essential metrics

## 3. System Design Discussion Response

"For tracking an insurance quote lifecycle microservice, I'd design a event-driven architecture with the following components:

### Core Microservice Design

1. **Quote Creation Service**
    
    - Responsible for initial quote generation
    - Validates input parameters
    - Generates unique quote ID
    - Publishes 'QuoteCreated' event
2. **Quote Pricing Service**
    
    - Subscribes to 'QuoteCreated' events
    - Applies complex risk assessment algorithms
    - Updates quote with calculated premium
    - Publishes 'QuotePriced' event
3. **Persistence & Audit Service**
    
    - Maintains PostgreSQL database
    - Tracks full quote lifecycle states
    - Implements event sourcing pattern

### Technical Considerations

- Use Apache Kafka for event streaming
- Implement circuit breakers for external API calls
- Design idempotent endpoints to prevent duplicate processing
- Implement comprehensive logging for compliance and debugging

### Database Schema Approach

```sql
CREATE TABLE quote_lifecycle (
    quote_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    current_state VARCHAR(50),
    customer_id UUID,
    initial_data JSONB,
    pricing_details JSONB,
    status_history JSONB
);
```

This design ensures:

- Scalability
- Auditability
- Flexible state tracking
- Performance under high load"
